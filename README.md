Project Made in ReactJS + NodeJS + MySQL

First of all clone the repository in your system then on command prompt naviagate to the same folder in which you cloned. Now run command 'npm install'. It will install all the required dependencies needed to run this project. Now open xampp and run mysql server. Create a database(name it anything) and create a table with following attributes name(VARCHAR 255), ID(INT), visiting_date(VARCHAR 255), dishes_ordered(VARCHAR 255).After this change mysql information in server.js.
Now run command 'npm run api' in one powershell and 'npm start' in another. 
And that's how you can see the work.
